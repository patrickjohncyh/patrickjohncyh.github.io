### [Waldo](https://github.com/patrickjohncyh/ibm-waldo)



WALDO is a Third Year Industrial Group Project done in collaboration with IBM. 
It is a deep learning enabled assisted living device meant to perform Makaton Sign recognition.
I was part of the team that focused on the Machine Learning reasearch, development and deployment.

At the core of WALDO is its deep neural network architecture based on a C3D network concatenated with an LSTM. 
This allows the model to learn the spatio-temporal features required for accurate gesture recognition.

Particularly challenging was having the model run on a Jetson Nano edge device. 
This required investigation into which parts of the model could be compressed, 
whilst achieving a good trade off between accuracy and performance.
