description: FSMD (F# Markdown) is a <strong>real-time markdown editor</strong>. The backend parser componenet, as the name suggests, is written in <strong>pure F#</strong>. The front-end uses the <strong><a href=https://electronjs.org/>electron</a></strong> framework inconjunction with F# that is transpiled into Javascript using <strong><a href=https://fable.io/>FABLE</a></strong>. Some user friendly frontend features such as auto-parsing upon typing were also added.</br></br> The challenge of this project was that the group had only a couple of weeks of F# experience before embarking on it. Extensive planning was done to ensure smooth integration of individual code.</br></br> More information available at <a href="https://github.com/patrickjohncyh/FSMD/tree/team-hlp-final/FSMD-master"> Github Repo </a>
