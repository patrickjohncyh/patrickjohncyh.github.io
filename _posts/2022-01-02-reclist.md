### [RecList](https://reclist.io/)  ðŸš€

We built `RecList` as an open source library for behavioral testing of recommender systems (RSs). As pervasive as RSs are in daily life,
insufficient attention has been put into better understanding their performance and behaviour beyond just point-wise metrics. 

We developed `RecList` to be modular in fashion with an easy-to-extend interface for custom use cases 
to enable the scaling up of behavioral testing.

`RecList` has since garnered > 300 ðŸŒŸ on GitHub and has been used as part of the evaluation
loop in the [`EvalRS` CIKM 2022 Data Challenge](https://reclist.io/cikm2022-cup/)
