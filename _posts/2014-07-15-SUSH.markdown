description: SUSH is a device that is deisgned to automatically detect the color of colored plates in a sushi restaurant. SUSH was built to demonstrate the capabilities of a Spectral Sensor (<a href='https://ams.com/as7262'>AS7262</a>), <strong>Internet of Things(IoT)</strong> technologies such as <strong><a href='http://mqtt.org/'>MQTT</a></strong> and other Web technologies such as <a href='https://reactjs.org/'>React</a>.</br></br> The Spectral Sensor is used to determine the colour of the plates by reading in the raw values and comparing (Euclidean Distance) against references for each color obtained from the average of a few samples. In order to deal with uncertain network conditions, the sensor reading process and data sending process is decoupled with the use of interrupt triggered threads and a shared queue. This allows users to input plates without being hindered by a slow network. <img src="img/portfolio/sush_app.png" class="img-responsive img-centered" alt="">The plate colour is sent from a Raspberry Pi to a central device (laptop) via MQTT. The sleek front end seen above is built using React to allow for dynamic updating of the collated bill.
