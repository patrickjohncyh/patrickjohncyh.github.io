### [GradREC](https://github.com/patrickjohncyh/gradient-recs)

`GradREC` is a zero-shot approach toward a new class of recommendation -- comparative recs -- which 
answers queries of the form: _"Can I have something darker/longer/warmer?"_. 

We achieve this by framing comparative recommendations as latent space traversal -- 
a key component of our approach is leveraging the latent space learnt by FashionCLIP,
a CLIP-like model fine-tuned for fashion concepts.

Like other self-supervised approaches for learning representations such as the seminal Word2Vec, 
we postulated that the contrastive learning approach employed by CLIP-like models should also
encode certain concepts (e.g. analogies) despite being unsupervised/self-supervised.

We demonstrate that it is possible to traverse the latent space in a manner whereby
we can discover products that vary along a certain attribute/dimension of interest 
(e.g. shoes of increasing/decreasing heel height).
